Commit messages should be both _clear_ and _descriptive_. If possible they should start with the _verb_ that describes the change.
Don't be shy to include additional information, like motivation, for that change below the initial line.

Other developers should be able to understand _why_ a change occurred, when looking at it at a later point in time.
